Hello, my name is Oracle. Here is all of the information I can provide you:

	• Fortune - I can tell you your fortune. Just type "@Oracle /fortune" followed by your question about your future
	
	• Questions - I can answer questions for you. Just type "@Oracle /question" followed by what you would like to know
	
	• Images - I can find images for you. Just type "@Oracle /img" followed by the image you would like to find
	
	• Animated Gifs - I can find gifs for you as well. Just type "@Oracle /gif" followed by the gif you would like to find

	• Stock Quotes - I can get the current quote for a stock as well as print a chart for a specified period of time. Just type "@Oracle /stock " followed by the symbol for the stock you want, as well as "/time " followed by the period of time. You can do "intraday", "X days", "X months", or "X years" for time options
	
I may have more features in the future when Basil gets off of his lazy ass and programs them, but this is it for now. Enjoy, gentlemen!
